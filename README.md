# Tools for Typst

> A utility package for typst package authors.

**Tools for Typst** (`t4t` in short) is a utility package for [Typst](typst/typst) package and template authors. It provides solutions to some recurring tasks in package development.

The package can be imported or any useful parts of it copied into a project. It is perfectly fine to treat `t4t` as a snippet collection and to pick and choose only some useful functions. For this reason, most functions are implemented without further dependencies. 

Hopefully, this collection will grow over time with *Typst* to provide solutions for common problems.
